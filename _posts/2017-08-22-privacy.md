1. ## Data Collection
	
    At present the privacy policy for {{ site.sitedomain }} and it's sub-domains is that:
    
	- **No data** is collected from users visiting . 
    - **No registration** or **sign-in** is required
	- **No data** is not stored.
    
    Should this policy change in the future, the updates will be posted on the home page with a link to the updated privacy statement.

1. ## Intermediaries

    The {{ site.sitedomain }} and it's sub-domains make use of an <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> to get content created by {{ site.author }} under the {{ site.aliases }} user name. 
    
    The {{ site.sitedomain }} API uses libraries / APIs provided by {{ site.accounts }} to access content on their site / platform / product. Getting the content presented on {{ site.sitedomain }} doesn't provide user data to these intermediaries. However, each content item links to the intermediary site in a new window and the appropriate intermediary's privacy policy will then apply.
    
1. ## Cookies

	{{ site.sitedomain }} uses a cookie stored on the user's machine and passes it to the {{ site.sitedomain }} API to identify {{ site.author }} user name ({{ site.aliases }}).
