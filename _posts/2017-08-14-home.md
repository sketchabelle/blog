## Instructions for editing

1. ### Create a post

	- in either _\_posts_ or _\_drafts- **folder** - use the (green0 new file button to create an _untitled_ file		

	- **change the `-your-filename`** part of the file name (at top above the formatting toolbar) to something representing the content in the post
	    - without spaces, or any of the following characters:  /  \  &  "  '  '  ‘  ’  ’  ‘  “  ”

	- **save the file** using the button in the right hand toolbar

	- now **change the file name to a title** that you wpuld like the link to be when in a list. 

1. ### Add meta-data
	
    > Noun - a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.
    
    ### _post_
    ```
    published: false
	categories: posts
	date: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0100'
    ```
	_Notes_:
	- change the `published` value to `true` when you want the post to appear on the site "blog" section.
    - some of sketchabele.com pages (home, copyright) use the blog function too. For these the `categories` value is set to `pages`. This will allow you to update the page's content without touching the code, and we can then add other pages/content using the same method.
